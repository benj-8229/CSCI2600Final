Lots of the projects on course page look 'academic', want something more artistic and maybe interactive
Doesn't have to be written in python

Ideas:
Converting an image into an ascii art rendering
Procedural images (mandelbrots, fractals)
Procedural animations (cellular automata, boids, particles)
Fragment shader ?
